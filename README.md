# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get a local [Kafka UI](https://docs.kafka-ui.provectus.io/) instance up and running for Nextiva Kafka Servers.

## What is this repository for? ##

* This repo is used to store configurations to spin up a local Kafka UI instance in as few steps as possible.
* This is 1.0.0 version, nothing will move too much, besides, version numbers.

## How do I get set up? ##

### Run ### 

* Prerequisites
  * You must have either [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) (only if you have a commercial license; as of 2022, we donâ€™t have such licenses available at Nextiva) or [Rancher Desktop with dockerd container runtime](https://rancherdesktop.io/) installed and running. If you are new to containers, you can learn a bit about them here: [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)
